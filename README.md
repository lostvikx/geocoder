My first time using a Google API.
## How to use
```
Enter location: Mumbai, India
```
### Results:
```
Status: OK
Street Address: Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
Coords: {'lat': 19.0759837, 'lng': 72.8776559}
Country Code: IN
```
### Notes
Going through and registering for the Google API developer program is an excruciating and painful task.

Although, their services are super cool.
